# wearablecleaningdata

This contains a few files and is responsible for ensuring that we get tidy data from a larger data

This repository contains:

    CodeBook.md: the codebook for the final dataset.
    README.md : this readme file.
    run_analysis.R : has a function run_Analysis() which returns tidy data set. It looks for the data in './UCI HAR Dataset'
    tidy data.txt : Tidy data output
    
We can execute this by calling the function run_Analysis() in RStudio
